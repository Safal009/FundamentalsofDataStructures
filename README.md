B. Highest score and lowest score of class
C. Marks scored by most of the students
D. list of students who were absent for the test

LA2 Write python program for to compute the following computation on matrix
A. Addition of two matrices
B. Subtraction of two matrices
C. Multiplication of two
D. Transpose of matrix

LA3 In Second year Computer Engineering class of M students, set A of students play
cricket and set B of students play badminton. Write python program to find and
displayA. Set of students who play either cricket or badminton or both
B. Set of students who play both cricket and badminton
C. Set of students who play only cricket
D. Set of students who play only badminton
E. Number of students who play neither cricket nor badminton

LA4. Write Python program to store first year percentage of students in array. Write
function for sorting array of floating point numbers in ascending order using
A. Selection Sort
B. Bubble sort and display top five scores.

L5.A) Write Python program to store roll numbers of student in array who attended
training program in random order. Write function for searching whether particular
student attended training program or not, using linear search and sentinel search.

LA6 Write Python program to store first year percentage of students in array. Write
function for sorting array of floating point numbers in ascending order using quick sort
and display top five scores.

LA7 The ticket booking system of Cinemax theater has to be implemented using C++ program.
There are 10 rows and 7 seats in each row. Doubly circular linked list has to be maintained to
keep track of free seats at rows. Assume some random booking to start with. Use array to store
pointers (Head pointer) to each row On demand
A. The list of available seats is to be displayed
B. The seats are to be booked
C. The booking can be cancelled

LA8. Second year Computer Engineering class set A of students like Vanilla Ice-cream and set B of
students like butterscotch ice-cream. Write C/C++ program to store two sets using linked list
compute and display
A. Set of students who like either vanilla or butterscotch or both
B. Set of students who like both vanilla and butterscotch
C. Set of students who like only vanilla not butterscotch
D. Set of students who like only butterscotch not vanilla
E. Number of students who like neither vanilla nor butterscotch

LA9. Implement C++ program for expression conversion as infix to postfix and its
evaluation using stack based on given conditions:
1. Operands and operator, both must be single character.
2. Input Postfix expression must be in a desired format.
Only '+', '-', '*' and '/ ' operators are expected.

LA10. In any language program mostly syntax error occurs due to unbalancing delimiter such as (),
{}, []. Write C++ program using stack to check whether given expression is well parenthesized
or not.

LA11. Queues are frequently used in computer programming and a typical example is the creation
of a job queue by an operating system. If the operating system does not use priorities, then the
jobs are processed in the order they enter the system. Write C++ program for simulating job
queue. Write functions to add job and delete job from queue

LA12. Pizza parlor accepting maximum M orders. Orders are served in first come first served
basis. Order once placed cannot be cancelled. Write C++ program to simulate the system using
circular queue using array.
